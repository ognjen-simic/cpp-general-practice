# Practice of C++ Basics

This repository contains my **6-day practice of various C++ concepts**. It was my final revision before **moving on to Front-end development**.

If you are a **beginner in C++**, you might find this repository helpful for **learning and revising** essential programming concepts through **simple examples**. Each folder contains small programs or exercises dedicated to a specific topic.

## Topics Covered

- Classes, Constructors, Destructors (`OOPbasics`)
- Inheritance and Polymorphism (`InheritanceAndPolymorphism`)
- RAII, Smart Pointers and Memory Management (`RAII`)
- Maps and Lambda Functions (`ContainersAndLambda`)
- Linked Lists and Recursion Basics (`LinkedLists`)
- Function / Class Templates (`Templates`)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ognjen-simic/cpp-general-practice.git
```
2. Navigate to the folder of the topic you want to explore
3. Open the `.cpp` files in your code editor
4. Compile them using:
```bash
g++ filename -o filename.exe
```
(**Assuming** you have the `g++` compiler)
Or run them yourself.

## Purpose

This repository served as my personal final review of C++ fundamentals before transitioning into web development. Iâ€™ve kept the examples simple so they can be easily understood by beginners and quickly reviewed by intermediate learners.
